# Express-Calculator

## Instructions
There are four operation values which a user may use: *addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.*
The route format to use is `http://localhost:3000/:operator/:num1/:num2`.

When that route is hit, your browser should display the result of the math operation and the two numbers on the screen.
For example, when the user goes to `http://localhost:3000/addition/10/1`, the page should display 11.

## How to run this application
- `npm install`
- `node calculator.js`
